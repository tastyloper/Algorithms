/**
 * 888. Fair Candy Swap
 *
 * Alice and Bob have candy bars of different sizes:
 * A[i] is the size of the i-th bar of candy that Alice has, and B[j] is the size of the j-th bar of candy that Bob has.
 * 
 * Since they are friends, they would like to exchange one candy bar each so that after the exchange, they both have the same total amount of candy.
 * (The total amount of candy a person has is the sum of the sizes of candy bars they have.)
 * 
 * Return an integer array ans where ans[0] is the size of the candy bar that Alice must exchange,
 * and ans[1] is the size of the candy bar that Bob must exchange.
 * 
 * If there are multiple answers, you may return any one of them.  It is guaranteed an answer exists.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: A = [1,1], B = [2,2]
 * Output: [1,2]
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: A = [1,2], B = [2,3]
 * Output: [1,2]
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: A = [2], B = [1,3]
 * Output: [2,3]
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * Input: A = [1,2,5], B = [2,4]
 * Output: [5,4]
 *  
 * Noteï¼š
 *  * 1 <= A.length <= 10000
 *  * 1 <= B.length <= 10000
 *  * 1 <= A[i] <= 100000
 *  * 1 <= B[i] <= 100000
 *  * It is guaranteed that Alice and Bob have different total amounts of candy.
 *  * It is guaranteed there exists an answer.
